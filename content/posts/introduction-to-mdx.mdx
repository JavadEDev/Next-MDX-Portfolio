## Introduction to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com 'MDX')

MDX lets you mix **Markdown** with **JSX components** to build interactive
documentation or pages.

## Markdown Section

- This is a bullet point.
- This is another bullet point.

You can also use JSX components inside an MDX file:

Here’s a small React component example:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => (
  <div style={{ padding: '10px', border: '1px solid black' }}>
    Hello, I'm a React component inside an MDX file!
  </div>
)
```

## What is MDX?

MDX stands for **Markdown + JSX**. It is an extension of Markdown that allows
you to use JSX (JavaScript XML) inside your Markdown files. With MDX, you can
embed interactive components within your Markdown content, making it a powerful
tool for creating rich, dynamic documents.

## Key Features of MDX

1. **Combines Markdown and JSX**: MDX extends the simplicity of Markdown, a
   lightweight markup language, by integrating JSX. This enables developers to
   include React components directly within Markdown files.

2. **Dynamic Content**: Unlike standard Markdown, which is limited to static
   content, MDX allows you to add dynamic content and interactivity by embedding
   React components.

3. **Fully Compatible with Markdown**: All regular Markdown syntax is supported
   in MDX. You can write headings, lists, code blocks, and everything else you
   would in standard Markdown, but with the added benefit of JSX components.

4. **Component-Based Documentation**: Since you can import and use React
   components, MDX is ideal for creating component-based documentation. This is
   particularly useful for teams working with design systems or reusable UI
   components.

## Example

```mdx
# Welcome to My Page

This is a standard Markdown paragraph.

<CustomButton label='Click Me' />

Here’s a list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

```
export syntax function getSource() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
}
```

# Why Use MDX?

MDX is gaining popularity among developers for its ability to combine the
simplicity of Markdown with the power of JSX. But why should you use MDX? Below
are several compelling reasons to consider using MDX for your next project.

## 1. **Seamless Integration of Components and Content**

MDX allows you to integrate React components directly into your Markdown. This
means you can include interactive elements, live previews, charts, or any custom
UI components without leaving your Markdown file.

# My Component Example

This is a regular Markdown section, but below is a React component:

Now you can visualize your data interactively!

# How to Use MDX?

MDX (Markdown + JSX) allows you to write Markdown files with embedded React
components, making it a powerful tool for building interactive and dynamic
content. Here's how to get started using MDX in your project.

## Step 1: Install MDX in Your Project

First, you'll need to install the necessary MDX packages. If you're using a
framework like Next.js or Gatsby, they already have plugins available for
integrating MDX.

### For a Next.js Project:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader
```

## Conclusion

Using MDX in your project enables you to create rich, dynamic content by
combining the simplicity of Markdown with the interactivity of JSX. With just a
few steps, you can set up MDX, write .mdx files, and render components within
your Markdown, making it a flexible tool for documentation, blogs, and more.
